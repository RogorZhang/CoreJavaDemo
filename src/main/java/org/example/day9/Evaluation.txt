Project:
    Rewards Restful

    A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
    A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction,
     plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

    Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

    Produce Restful APIs for get customer's reward points. By customized input like user-id, user-name.
    Use common sense to make assumptions.
